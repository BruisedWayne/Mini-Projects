This is my attempt at a web scraper, this one hits the Amazon page for the comic Halo: Escalation 24 hours and catalogues the price and the timestamp into a CSV file, which can eventually be used as its own dataset.

Since I would have to leave this running over at least a couple of months to get meaningful fluctutation in price, I have not added the target CSV file in this repository. I hope to add it some day should I ever leave my laptop running for that long.

Link to the page it hits:
