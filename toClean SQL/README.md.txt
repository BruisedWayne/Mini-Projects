This mini-project's purpose was for me to learn what to look out for when cleaning data. The dataset contains housing data from Nashville (USA), and can be found in its folder.

Steps taken to clean the data:

1. Standardized Date Format
2. Populated Property Address Data
3. Split Address into Address, City, State
4. Standardized values of "Sold as Vacant" field
5. Removed Duplicate Rows
6. Deleted Unused Columns
